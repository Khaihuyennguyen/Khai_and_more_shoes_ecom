# Khai&More â€” Designing Sale page of an eCommerce website

In this project, my goal is to finish building a sale page of an e-commerce store!

This project focuses only on CSS and uses Create React App to create a basic e-commerce website.

As a result, the links and inputs will not function properly.

To get started, run the following terminal commands:

- `npm install`
- `npm run start`

You can then visit the app in-browser; it defaults to http://localhost:3000.

_Note that I am only focusing on the design._ The links and inputs don't do anything.

> **More challenges to come**
>
> As stated, this project only focuses on CSS. In the future, I will add more features
> to this website such as animation, mobile-friendly, features, API...
